# JO
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, and I'll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever , ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
"Were just friends," what are you saying
Said "there's another," and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time
